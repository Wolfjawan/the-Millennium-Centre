        <h2>The Millennium Centre Wildlife </h2>
        <div>

        <p >
          There is a great variety of wildlife in the area including birds, bees and butterflies.
            <h3>
            Birds
              </h3>
          Skylarks are becoming rare, probably because of the chemicals used by farmers.Eastbrookend and The Chase are chemical free zones which means visitors have plenty of opportunity to listen out
          for the music of the skylarks.
          During the summer months the scrubland provides valuable feeding and nesting habitat
          for small birds such as the blackcap. Eastbrookend has also proved to be a good breeding ground
          for lapwings.
          The winter berries that adorn most bushes attract hungry birds such as fieldfares and redwings that fly all the way from the Arctic to feast at the Eastbrookend.Another bird on the lookout
          for food is the kestrel.
          Woodpeckers are regularly seen flying over the area and come to rest on trees of the woodlands.Mallards and tufted ducks can be seen swimming on the ponds and some of the largest flocks of water birds in east London have settled in the area.
          Herons are natural hunters and dive
          for frogs and other tasty morsels of food in the lakes and ponds in the area.
            <h3>
            Dragonflies
              </h3> Dragonflies are fierce hunters of flying insects.The dragonfly larvae lives under water and will eat most other water creatures and small fish.
          <h3>
            Butterflies and wild bees
            </h3> The area has been planted with grasses and flowers so there is lots of nectar and pollen to attract wildlife.Butterflies and wild bees abound and the area is home to wild bees that live alone and not in crowds like honeybees.
         <h3>
            Black poplars
           </h3> There are 7 mature black poplar trees at Eastbrookend.There are only around 2, 000 black poplars in the whole of the country and somehow these 7 trees have managed to survive the gravel digging and dumping in the area.
         The trees are now able to grow safely inside the Chase, which is a London Wildlife Trust nature reserve.
